# TD3 with Prioritized Experience Replay  
**Reinforcement Learning Module — University of Tuebingen**

---

## Overview

This project implements **Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3)** enhanced with **Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)**.  
It was developed as part of the *Reinforcement Learning* module at the University of Tuebingen.

The models were trained and evaluated in a **continuous-control air hockey simulation environment**, where the agent learns to control a hockey player to score goals against an opponent.
